#### DS 223: Marketing Analytics
##### Social Network Analysis Homework

The objective is to assist the marketing department or a Marketing Agency in identifying the key individuals to focus on. The budget is limited, so it's crucial to help the marketing specialist figure out exactly who to target. To achieve this, several steps are undertaken. First, a directed graph is constructed using data from connections.txt. The analysis involves identifying nodes that function as bridges and calculating the graph's density for further analysis. Additionally, nodes possessing the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality are explored. Furthermore, a community detection algorithm is implemented on the directed graph, revealing the number of communities formed. Special attention is given to illustrating the influencers within the top three communities. Lastly, a strategic action plan is developed to use the insights gained from the analysis.
